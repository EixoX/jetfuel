# Welcome to eixox's Jetfuel
We've made this library to provide state of the art aspect driven utilities as well as a nice usecase programming paradigm.
It is and always will be zero dependencies. That is, we'll only put core code in here. Nothing will depend on anything else.
By using our library you have access to:
* Annotation based restrictions to improve validations.
* A persistence api with direct I/O to databases, files, no-sqls etc.
* An aspect driven api for reflection.
* A usecase programming paradigm that enables deploys on any servlet container or on amazon lambda.

**Step 0:** Fork or clone this repo. 

Hint: Forking is easier to update from our mainstream and also easier to help us fix bugs in the unlikely event that one is found.
